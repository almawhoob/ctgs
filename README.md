# CTGS
Imagine this is a paragraph telling you something about the project. To help you imagine this is a paragraph, I have to write more than one sentence. However, I think two sentences are not enought to imagine that this is a paragraph, so I just added this third sentence. Now, if you coudn't imagine that this is a paragraph, then sorry, I cannot help your imagination.

## Dependencies
- You must have `node` and `npm` installed (via `brew install node` or [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/));
- You must also have `typings` installed globally via `npm i -g typings`
- Be sure that you have `typings` version `1.x`

## Getting Started


```bash
git clone https://github.com/almawhoob/ctgs.git
cd ctgs
npm install
typings install
npm start
```

Then navigate your browser to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and use the app.

## Testing
The test setup includes `webpack.test.config.js`, `spec-bundle.js`, and `karma.conf.js`. To run unit tests, execute `npm test` in your terminal.
